After hours of research and testing, assumed that SVC could my potential choice. Working with the provided code,
model gave me a lot of questions. When talking about the models and measures, I have to admit that the provided model
was one of the best models out of the list, however, the set up was very simple. I know that this task checks the
understanding of the code and models, however, in order to perform the best results possible, we should dive in deeper
into the settings and make sure that the ground for those models is tuned up.
Just by looking at the documentation for each option, I can state that there is a lot of settings that can be done for
each model. I know that we have to search based on our provided data, however, there is so many options that people
tried to perform and the accuracy is just different but small fraction of the percent.
So, going back to my chosen model, I just went ahead and changed the build feature to make sure that we have our data
represented in binary structure which would fit both models, RFC and SVC.
After setting up both training function and predict function, I got quite satisfying results.

Going back to the full set up.
Every single function is in the seprate file. Main.py is the main functions that does all the work.
Kept the files (preprocess and build features) separated to make sure that we can reuse them or modify specific part only.
