After hours of research and testing, assumed that SVC could my potential choice. Working with the provided code,
model gave me a lot of questions. When talking about the models and measures, I have to admit that the provided model
was one of the best models out of the list, however, the set up was very simple. I know that this task checks the
understanding of the code and models, however, in order to perform the best results possible, we should dive in deeper
into the settings and make sure that the ground for those models is tuned up.
Just by looking on the documentation for each option there is a lot of settings that can be done for the each model.
I know that we have to search based on our provided data, however, there is so many options that people try to perform
and the accuracy is just different but small fraction ofr the percent.
So, going back to my chosen model, i just went ahead and change the build feature to make sure that we have our data
represented in binary structure which would fir both models, RFC and SVC.
After setting up both training function and predict function, I got quite satisfying results.
(NA or NULL entries were ignored)

RFC:

Going back to the full set up.
Created two similar files and tried to keep the same method of creating the model and reusing it in the prediction
Kept the files (preprocess and build features) separated to make sure that we can reuse them or modify specific part only.
Incorporated function that is used in the predict and train files that makes file to go throughout the preprocess first and
building features.
